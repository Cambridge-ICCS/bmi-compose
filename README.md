# bmi-compose

The [Basic Model Interface](https://github.com/csdms/bmi) is an interface specification
to enable coupling of models to models and models to data. The BMI definition has
cross language support.

This repository provides a set of combinators for __composing__ models implementing the Basic Model Interface.
It implements an algebraic, compositional theory for BMI models that enables coupled modles by composition.

# Status
This code is in very early stages of development.
